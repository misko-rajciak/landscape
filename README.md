summary of this project:

-took me about 8 hours to finish this, I feel like I have learned huge amount of things with it
-I feel like I'm using too many <div> tags, I don't know maybe it is supposed to be like that
-overall very satisfied with my work, I really surprised myself with it, a week ago I was here struggling
with the things I am easily solving now
-found amazing use of Chrome devtools, they are an absolute necessity when it comes to building a website,
can't believe i wanted to bail on the devtools lesson just because it wasn't very entertaining
